## Description

The purpose of this course is to give you the statistical and analytical tools to describe datasets. The course enables you to calculate statistical properties of data, describe them in scientifically accurate language, plot them as diagrams and to report them in an informative way. You will critically evaluate data reports and learn about statistical pitfalls and their dangers.

During the course, you will perform calculations manually and with the help of a programming environment. The examples will be in the Python language using the libraries `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` and `statsmodels`. No prior programming experience is required.

I strongly recommend installing the **Anaconda** Python distribution from [www.anaconda.com/](https://www.anaconda.com/) before the course starts.
