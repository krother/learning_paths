instructions for students in German: [github.com/krother/datenvisualisierung/blob/main/dashboard/streamlit.rst](https://github.com/krother/datenvisualisierung/blob/main/dashboard/streamlit.rst)


## Comments:

This lesson works even if the students had little exposure to Python/pandas before.
It helps if they are familiar with the terminal but the lesson might also
be used to make a point why the terminal is useful.
