# Centrality and Dispersion

## Lesson Goal:

Students calculate measures of centrality and dispersion from data

## Time Frame:

180'

## Key Concepts:

#### Types of Variables

* category
* ordinal
* scalar
* datetime
* discrete
* continuous

#### Measures of Centrality

* mean
* median
* mode

#### Measures of Dispersion

* range
* standard deviation
* quartiles

### 1. Introduction Ball Game

* Pass the ball in a sequence to everybody, say your name when you have the ball
* 2nd round in same order, say the name of the next person
* 3rd round faster
* 4th round backwards

### 2. Front Matter

* introductions
* goal of the course
* map of statistics (main concepts)
* rules (CoC)
* examination
* contact

### 3. Data Portrait

### 4. Collect student data in a spreadsheet

* ask "how can we store data"?
* create an online spreadsheet
* share an editable link
* give students time to enter their data from the data portrait
* identify and discuss variable types
* With computer scientists, I spend some time disambiguating the term **variable type** from **data type**.

### 5. Groups research one of the 6 metrics each

* form 6 groups
* ask them to research one of the centrality/dispersion metrics, explain the equation and calculate it using the student data
* bonus: find out pros and cons
* hand out cards with the 6 metrics, one per group
* time: 10 minutes

### 6. Groups report on the board

* starting from centrality

### 7. Discuss tricky cases

* mean of a ranked variable (doesnt work)
* examine the effect of outliers
* what is the average family size? (overrepresentation)
* is the average number of characters a lot or not? (comparison)

### 8. Draw plots on the board

Introduce 2 plots:

* bar plot
* box plot

### 9. Exercises with Python

Work in pairs. Every pair needs one machine.

### 10. Cooldown: Brainstorm words

Randomize pairs. Write down in 1 minute up to 7 words about a topic.
Each word gives 1 point. Unique words 3 points. Play 3 rounds:

- statistics
- diagrams
- Python

Find out who the winner is and send them home.

## Material:

The following exercise set can be done in Python or an online spreadsheet:
