# The Scientific Method

## Time Frame:

## Key Concepts:

* hypothesis
* observation
* experiment
* falsification
* assumption
* Occhams razor

TODO: add diagram

## Warmup:

Ask students to write down some facts:

* one facts they are 100% sure of
* one facts they are not so sure of

Collect the facts on a board.
Discuss the examples together. Ask: "how do we know things?"

## Content Delivery:

Take one example from the facts, e.g. "there are less than 600 wolves in Brandenburg". This is super hard to prove true, but easy to falsify.

Go through a diagram illustrating the scientific method.
They should arrive at the conclusion that science rarely proves facts,
but disproves other plausible alternatives most of the time.

The lesson is a preparation for [hypothesis testing](hypothesis_testing.md),
because it establishes the concept of *hypotheses* that must be falsifiable.

## Material:

you could refer to *"The structure of scientific revolutions"* by Thomas Kuhn but it is an oldschool book.

## Comments:

I had a priest of Pastafarianism in my class which helped a lot to reinforce the difference between religion (which essentially makes lots of assumptions)
versus science (less assumptions and falls apart more easily, but does make detailed predictions that have practical value). The two are not in a conflict per se.
