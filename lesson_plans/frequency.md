# Frequency

## Lesson Goal:

Students create pivot tables and histograms.

## Time Frame:

18'

## Key Concepts:

* absolute frequency
* relative frequency
* pivot table
* histogram
* aggregate
* normalize

## Warmup:

Wordle: RANGE

## Content Delivery:

1. Load the penguin dataset into a data tool the students are familiar with.
2. Count penguins by one category and put the data on the board to establish **abolute frequency**.
3. Calculate percentages to establish **relative frequency**
4. Count penguins by another category and establish counts as well
5. You end up with a pivot table (two categories + one aggregation), make sure to have it on the board
6. Discuss that there are three ways to calculate percentages (by row, by col, globally), establish **normalization**
7. Discuss the anatomy of a histogram on the board and how **binning** is related to it.

Follow up with a student exercise to create pivots and draw a histogram.

### Extras:

* vary the aggregation function
* draw a bar chart
* draw a heat map of the normalized frequencies

## Comments:

The lesson works with both Excel and Python, depending on the students knowledge.
The pivot feature in Excel is nice, but the histograms look awful. You may want to use a grouped bar plot instead.

Instead of the penguin data, I want to use my *quartet of countries* to put the students fully in charge of the data (to be tested).
