# Correlation

## Lesson Goal:

Students calculate correlation coefficients.

## Time Frame:

90'

## Key Concepts:

* correlation coefficient
* scatter plot
* causation

## Warmup:

Show some plots from the website [Spurious Correlations](https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations). Ask students what they think.

## Content Delivery:

* create a scatterplot from a sample of quartet cards
* look for linear relationships (establish **correlation**)
* introduce the equation for the correlation coefficient
* go through possible values of R and their interpretation
* exercise: play [www.guessthecorrelation.com/](https://www.guessthecorrelation.com/)
* calculate the correlation coefficient for one example
* create a heat map of correlations of all against all columns

## Material:

- quartet cards
- alternative: penguin data or any other dataset with multiple variables

## Comments:

Correlation as a concept is much easier to establish if students worked with linear regression before. Likewise, the equation for R using covariance can be comfortably replaced by:

$r = \frac{m \cdot std_x}{std_y}$

which is a lot more digestible than the equation using covariance.

You might want to introduce $r^2$ as a metric for the quality of the linear fit, take note to emphasize how the square changes things.
