# My First Plot

## Lesson Goal:

Students create a bar plot in Python.

## Time Frame:

90'

## Key Concepts:

* CSV
* pandas
* DataFrame
* Series
* plot

## Warmup:

show ~6 examples of good and bad plots (took them from Claus Wilkes book)
and discuss which are good/bad and why.

## Content Delivery:

Students go through the following recipe:

1. install anaconda
2. launch an IDE (Spyder or Jupyter)
3. load penguin data from a CSV file
4. aggregate the DataFrame
5. create a plot
6. save the plot to a .png file

### Extra challenges:

- change the aggregation function
- change the aggregated column
- change the plot type

### Questions:

- what is an absolute and what a relative path?
- what is in a CSV file?
- what is a DataFrame?
- how can you inspect a DataFrame?
- how do image formats differ?

## Comments:

I used this lesson for a first contact with Python.
If the students are familiar with Python and have it installed it should go twice as fast.
